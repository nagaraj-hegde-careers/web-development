/**
 * Problem Statement:

You are given an array of objects representing transactions made by customers. Each object contains the following properties:

customerId: Number, representing the unique ID of the customer.
amount: Number, representing the amount of the transaction.
date: String, representing the date of the transaction (in the format "YYYY-MM-DD").
Your task is to write a JavaScript function using functional programming techniques that takes this array of transaction objects and returns an object containing the following information:

totalTransactions: Total number of transactions.
totalAmount: Total amount of all transactions.
averageTransactionAmount: Average amount of transactions.
transactionsPerDay: An object where keys are dates and values are arrays containing transactions made on that date.
transactionsByCustomer: An object where keys are customer IDs and values are arrays containing transactions made by that customer.
